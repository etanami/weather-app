# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project is an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Methodization
I modified the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. Here i had to create get & post routes in both files so as to get the information needed from the Weather API, then post the needed information in the app endpoint. With this new data, I was able to update the UI dynamically. After all was done, I updated the `style.css` , to style the application to my customized perfection.

## Instructions
